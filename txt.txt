listeners are fired from the target of an event.

- Syntext of event bubbling:

addEventListener(type, listener, useCapture)

- type− It used to refer to the type of event.

- listener− The function which we want to call when the event of the particular type occurs.

- userCapture− it is a Boolean value. It indicates the event phase. It will be false by default and that indicates it is in the bubbling phase.

into another function as argument so that we can use it later.We use callback function to execute only after another function completes it's execution.
